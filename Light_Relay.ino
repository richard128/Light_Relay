/*
  Physical Pixel

  An example of using the Arduino board to receive data from the computer. In
  this case, the Arduino boards turns on an LED when it receives the character
  'H', and turns off the LED when it receives the character 'L'.

  The data can be sent from the Arduino Serial Monitor, or another program like
  Processing (see code below), Flash (via a serial-net proxy), PD, or Max/MSP.

  The circuit:
  - LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground

//  Description: This Arduino code should turn on and of the relay accordingly to a
//  Matlab script, and how the code communicate to it over serial. 
//  NOTE: This code was not created by any member of the team, the Arduino IoT Project member just added more comment into the code.

const int ledPin = 13; // the pin that the LED is attached to
int incomingByte;      // a variable to read incoming serial data into

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // see if there's incoming serial data:
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    // read the oldest byte in the serial buffer:
    incomingByte = Serial.read();
    // if it's a capital H (ASCII 72), turn on the LED:
    if (incomingByte == 'H') {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    }
    // if it's an L (ASCII 76) turn off the LED:
    if (incomingByte == 'L') {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
